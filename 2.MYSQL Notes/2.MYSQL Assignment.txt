TABLE DESCRIPTIONS

The following set of tables make up a database that is used by a booking agency to book hotel reservations for their client hotels. Attributes that are underscored make up the primary key for that table.

Type of room is a one-character code that refers to smoking (S) or non-smoking (N). Price refers to the price of the room per night.

In Room table Hotel_No and Room_No combined makes the primary_key


Hotel                (Hotel_No, Name, City)

Room               (Room_No, HotelNo, Type, Price)

Booking            (Hotel_No, GuestNo, Date_From, Date_To, Room_No)

Guest               (Guest_No, Name, City)
 

For every table, it is up to you to decide which is the appropriate datatype for each one of the columns based on the column descriptions given above. If you make assumptions that affect the way you define the columns, please note those assumptions in your assignment.

Alter the table Room and make the Type column default value to (N) non smoking
Alter the table Booking and add column created_date with datatype datetime and default value to system timestamp
Alter the table guest and add column gender
